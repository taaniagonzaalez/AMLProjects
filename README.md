# INSTRUCTIONS

- In order to not have everything in a single file, take **preprocessing** file as a template.

- If you want to improve the preprocessing part, just create a new version of the preprocessing file.

- If you want to train a model, just create a new file from the template and rename the file with the name of the model. If you want to improve a model, just rename it with the name of the model and v{number of version}
